:summary: working hours in software industry

Many IT companies are eyeing the option of mid-week breaks, where instead of the traditional two day off on Saturday and Sunday an alternative off policy can be taken where off from work can be given on maybe Wednesday or Thursday and another off on Sunday. Proponents bring to light the fact that in the high stress environment of IT industries, the resources get burnt out even before the five day week is over.

The concept of Sunday off comes from the Abrahamic religions where Sunday is kept for church and religious activities. With greater social and economic gains especially in the US the amount of work hours decreased till Henry Ford standardised the five hour work weeks in 1926. In 1938 the United States passed a law where the maximum number of hours was fixed at 40. The software industry took this concept from the west and have standardised the five hour work week in India.

Many people are even seeking a greater reduction in the work weeks notably the 4 day work weeks which they claim will have increase effect on productivity. Another notable experiment is being conducted in Sweden where the number of working hours per day has been decreased to 6 hours only. The real question is that will such measures work.

It makes me really apprehensive. The six hour work days are maybe too less. Experience tells me I am only able to work at my peak productivity for 4 hours only. That means when I am at office for my whole 9 hours, taking only short bathroom breaks and breaks to have lunch or dinner and I don't waste my time in any other activities like office gossip and other potentially time consuming tasks, still I am only able to be really productive for only 4 hours, which is less that 50% of my total gross time. And I am at my peak productivity on some days only. I guess my average productivity should range between two to three hours.

Now if you are shaking your head and saying that this guy must be lazy, I am definitely more productive than him; I suggest you try out this experiment on yourself. I use our old trusted MS Excel and the way I do it is by creating a timer to track how much I work on a specific task. The link is given `here`_. Now don't get me wrong. I am all for shortening the number of hours per day. But I guess 6 hours is too small. Maybe they were thinking that people will work for six hours straight without breaks. I don't think that's possible.

Coming back to the option of mid week break, that's interesting because as a dev-ops guy and having spent many months in Application support I have had to come on Saturdays and take off on some specific days of the week. I was less hassled with traffic when I went to work on Saturdays but my social life had also gone for a toss as I couldn't go for weekend trips nor could I even meet people as they were more inclined to come out on Saturdays and preferred to stay at home on Sundays so that they could rest adequately before the coming Monday. One thing was that I had gotten used to the short work cycles and whenever I got five day work weeks I was really exhausted on the fifth day. I was also getting used to the fact that the office was quiet on Saturdays and thus I could concentrate better. The work load also was less and hence I could devote more time to personal projects. But I would say again that I was interrupted more often and we all know how hard it is to come back to the flow once you are interrupted.

All in all I am slightly more interested in having a five day continuous work week albeit with slightly smaller hours. For people who feel burnt out my the middle of the week I would suggest them to practise yoga.
