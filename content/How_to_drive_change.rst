PM: Those two new issues are absolutely critical. They have to go in to the next drop.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
Me: I only have time to do one before I leave. Which one's most important?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
PM: Both are critical. They won't accept the build if both aren't in. They have to be in.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
Me: Well, I don't see how that's possible. I've estimated them at two hours each, and I don't have that much time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
PM: Can you come in on Friday? (Friday is traditionally a holiday.)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
Me: No, I'll be out of town.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
PM: Okay, well, they have to be in. Can't you just do them tonight?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
Me: I have to meet someone at the airport. The latest I can leave is 6:30, which doesn't give me enough time to do both.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
PM: It's critical that these two things be in the drop. Can't you just come in on Friday?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
Me: No, I'll be out of town.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
PM: Who else is qualified to do work on these issues?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
Me: Joe or John.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
PM: John's wife just had a baby, and Joe's going to be at the beach on Friday. If you can't do these tonight, I'll have to call John or Joe.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
Me: My estimate for these two tasks is four hours. I've estimated them in the best way I know how. I don't see how I can get them done tonight.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
PM: Can you come in for just a few hours Friday morning?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
Me: I'll be out of town.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
PM: Where?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>
Me: (My home town, two hours away.)

Everybody I know had these kind of conversation with his supervisor or project manager at some point of time. If you are also one of them I bet you are in a project which runs on the waterfall model. Maximum people will just succumb to the pressure and work extra hours to instead of thinking the root cause for this kind of behaviour in the company. This excerpt has been taken from  J<a href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Change-Diary/">ames Shore article</a>. For people new to agile processes I would say this is a must read. I myself have taken a lot of points from his articles and will try to drive change at my own place of work. At this point of time this definitely seems do-able.
