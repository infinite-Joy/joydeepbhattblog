Today I went to the first <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/india-dev-connect/">IBM developer connect 2016</a> event which was organised in KTPO, Whitefield, Bangalore. It was very cool. IBM brought out all stops to showcase their developer talent to the whole developer community. This at least brought me over, especially since my friends know how I feel about IBM, having worked in the WebSphere related technologies my whole professional career. They at least made me rethink that maybe I should not judge a company just by one product. The DevConnect conference itself generated a lot of enthusiasm as can be seen from the 3100 developers attending this from Bangalore and 10000 joining live from various other cities of India and around the globe.

How I reached the venue will make a story by itself so will not go into the details. Will just say this that the gods of Bangalore traffic were in a playful mood today. One thing let to another and things escalated. Still somehow reached there finding that I had missed the speech by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leefaus">Lee Faus</a>. Had talks with him in the <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> booth; a very intelligent and engaging man, but more on that later.

Lets look into the various speeches that happened there. Of course this is not exhaustive and this only includes those parts which I had the chance to hear or attend myself. Also a disclaimer that in-case some portions of this is not factually correct as I am basically recalling maximum portions from memory, please point it out in the comments.

Tanmay Bakshi: This is a 12 years old software developer, a 7th grader, who had pretty interesting things to say. One was how to create mobile apps and web services leveraging the IBM Watson service. One interesting idea is the creation of the QA as a service. This brings up interesting ideas about QA. There are many low end and repeated tasks in QA which can be automated through an intelligent system based on those levels.

Sridhar Sudarsan: Sridhar and his team took us through an interesting set of use case scenarios focusing on the use of the IBM Watson and how it will help a hypothetical guy named Karthik make sense of his insurance claims. The story goes like this. Karthik is an normal IT engineer and he commutes to office on his bike. So one day he was speeding because he was thinking about some deadline of his and he met with an accident. Luckily nothing happened to him but his bike suffered damages to the extent that now he needs to file insurance claims.

So he might call up the call center of his insurance company. Typically this routed to an agent and on many occasions the conversation is not of liking of the customer. BPO and call center services spend lakhs of rupees to ensure that their staff is trained adequately to handle all customer and their issues. But still in many cases customer satisfaction is sub par. So here a use case is there were an intelligent bot might be able to handle atleast some of the routine questions that will need to be asked to the customer who might be submitting a claim.

Again the bot might just ask Karthik to submit two photographs, one of the total shape of his bike and the other clearly displaying the registration number or the number plate. The model then can do complicated text processing or image processing to determine the condition of the bike and the registration id and escalate the case to the concerned department or customer relationship manager.

Then there is also the scenario where Karthik might be chatting with a real representative but there might be a bot monitoring the conversation and looking for undertones in the voice patterns of Karthik and thus alert the representative to tweak his approach accordingly to provide the best customer satisfaction. Alternatively, at the very onset itself there might be a management system which will match the specific customer to the specific type of customer representative. To build profiles on the customer, the insurance company in this case might make use of the social footprint of the customer. This I found a little bit disconcerting as it totally supports the saying that caring about public privacy is a joke in developer circles and they can do anything for data (not sure if pun should be intended). In any case I found this idea of matching the customer to the representative by some parameter interesting. We know that today we just see who is available first and then routing to that person.

Manisha Sharma: Manisha along with her fellow speakers Thejaswini shared us the understanding of how we can easily put our mobile applications in the cloud and thus leverage the capabilities of the IBM Bluemix. Vidyasagar came to us with the news that since now Swift is open source and available on Linux, we can do both client side and server side coding in the same environment and programming language. I am sure this will be a great boon to the iOS developers who traditionally don't have much leeway into general web based technologies.

Kalyan Varma: I appreciate that they kept a non technical speaker too in this event and the focus of this talk was about the culture of sharing knowledge and open source. Its a waste when two poeple are doing the same work and they are not able to collaborate just because maybe they are working in different companies or worse, same company and different projects. Kalyan also gave us glimpses into the work that he is doing and how he is trying to bring about consciousness into the minds of the people regarding the damage that our environment is taking right now.

Simon Wheatcroft: This was a brilliant speech on the use of technology to go beyond our human limitations and trust that with sheer determination and trust in our abilities, we can accomplish anything. In his own saying he refuses to let blindness hold him back. He has Retinitis Pigmentosa, a rare genetic eye disorder. He has partnered with leading technology firms (IBM, MIT and Google) so that he can build technologies which help him be a better runner and that he is never again held back from completing a marathon or climbing a mountain just because he cant see. I think this is what should be the main goal of technology, to enable average individuals achieve extraordinary feats.

The booths outside were pretty amazing too. There was a cognitive fashion area where demos were shown regarding the use case you upload an image to the search engine or any other, maybe eCommerce, platform of your choice and you get recommendations which reflect the thing that you are looking for. There was the IOT Foosball where the Foosball was monitored and recorded and only those players could play who had login into the players.

There was another booth with Equipment Condition Monitoring where an raspberry pi was integrated with a sensor (a water level indicator) and this was integrated with IBM bluemix from where the whole operation is controlled. There were demos on predictive customer insights with focus on retail. Another booth generated much enthusiasm was about creating effective social programs. The guy there was talking about creating social programs which save the time for people like social workers, for whom time is of essence, but who also receive a lot of prank calls. As social worker has to give with many people who need help mentally and psychologically. Also he needs to look into each case as all cases can have potential serious patients. So solutions that can be given by artificial intelligent assistant maybe useful to weed out such fake calls for cases and help the worker to deal with the real ones.

There were some robotic startups that also came and they had a lot of interesting technologies on display. Among them was a 3D printer and some drone technologies. Seemed interesting for drone powered home delivery systems.

One booth was explaining on how to use IBM Bluemix in monitoring the usage of cars for a car company like Uber or for a rental company. This came with a small device in the car that works on 3G wifi technology. Another similar technology was the control of a drone. We could have a sensor wrapped around the head which could read facial movements like the raising of the eye brows which translated to take off. Super cool was the demonstration of the robot shown above in the picture which could understand human gestures.


Regarding branching techniques, an interesting idea that he has seen was that people have three kinds of branching. There is the master, one is for the feature branch. One is for immediate bug fixes. This is for small teams of 10-100. For large teams they can have an additional branch which is the integration branch that sits between the master and the feature branch. This can have names like sprint005 denoting the sprint number. In this way the developers will have the knowledge that all the changes or the goals of this sprint will go to this integration stream before being merged. And yes in your local machine, make as many branches as possible. Branches are really light weight and there is no overhead in creating or maintaining them. Its only to chose a sound naming convention for the branches and stick to it.

When I asked him about mercurial, he was all praises saying that he is a fan of distributed source control system. Mercurial in not bad technology per-se, its just bad marketing. There are many things in mercurial that he would like to see in git, and there are many things in git that he would like to see in mercurial.

Lastly, thanks to the awesome Rock band <a href="http://lagori.in/">Lagori</a> for the hair raising performance at the end.

All in all very happy to see that IBM is really invested in the developer culture in India and looking forward to the conference next year.
