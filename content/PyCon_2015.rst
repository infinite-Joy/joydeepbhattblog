:summary: What happened at PyCon 2015

The past weekend Oct(2-4) was a very exhilarating experience as I could attend the Pycon India 2015. The main focus that I found in this years' conference was addressing the problem of scalability using `ansible`_. I attended a workshop where they showed how to use the ansible and how to create a playbook which can be used to manage scripts. There were other talks where the devops guys at LinkedIn gave a talk on how they manage hundreds of servers and how they leveraged the technology of bit-torrent to sync large amount of data between servers.

Both the keynote speakers talked about using python powered technology aids for education in our schools and classrooms. The other focus points was Django and the research going on in NLP techniques. I am personally not very hopeful about the integration of the ambiguity of words in a programming language. Words make sense depending on the context and hence if we are able to come up with a vocabulary that is able to correctly guess the meaning of the words that we input, isn't it the birth of a new programming language. I guess the specs were designed keeping in view this goal in mind. In taking such tools to our production environment we need to be very careful on the limit and scope of such tools.

Interesting dialogues did happen surrounding the topics of metaprogramming. Metaprogramming is generally frowned on in python circles as it is considered unpythonic. But as we found out metaprogramming has been given a lot of support in python 3+. In python 3x we have a new attribute of functions and classes called the __qualname__ which can be used for quite some new techniques. Interestingly ast was always there although it was the more unknown features of python 2.x.

The attendance was very good with above 1000 attendees. Sex diversity has also been appreciable with a good increase in women attendees. The organisers had provided child care facilities which was a laudable effort from their part. A large part of the crowd were the students from various colleges across India. I guess the main reason is that the Indian Software community hasn't gone mainstream with python and hence the mass contributions in python are from the student community. The other thing that could be done is that as one keynote speaker suggested some hours could be set aside where children could come and attend and give their input. Sometimes these small brains are the places where brilliant ideas germinate.

One of the best avenues where the best minds in the country meet and share. Looking forward to the next PyCon conference next year.
